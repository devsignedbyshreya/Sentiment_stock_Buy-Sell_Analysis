  <h1>Stock Sentiment Analysis for Buy/Sell Prediction</h1>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project aims to apply <strong>sentiment analysis</strong> on financial news tweets to predict whether a stock should be <strong>bought</strong> or <strong>sold</strong>. 
    By analyzing the sentiment embedded in market-related text data, we attempt to provide a basic indicator of market mood and trading decisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    While not intended to replace financial expertise, this model serves as a <em>proof of concept</em> for how <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> can be applied in stock market analytics.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    Stock prices are heavily influenced by public perception, news events, and investor sentiment. Positive news can drive prices up, while negative headlines often result in price drops.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project explores:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How textual sentiment correlates with market movements</li>
    <li>Whether we can predict buy/sell signals from sentiment scores</li>
    <li>The effectiveness of NLP techniques on short-form financial text like tweets</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Dataset</h2>
  <p>
    We use a dataset of stock-related tweets labeled for sentiment analysis. This dataset includes tweets about financial markets and companies, along with sentiment labels.
